The **AI Interview Question Generator** is an intelligent tool that helps recruiters and job seekers prepare for interviews. The system allows users to **upload a resume** and **job description (JD)**, choose the **number of questions**, and select a **complexity level** — *Basic*, *Medium*, or *Advanced*.
